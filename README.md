¡¡¡ Important !!!

of folders make that the app reduce attachment, this project also applies dependency injections. 

¡¡¡¡¡¡----VERY IMPORTANT NOTE----!!!!!!

I had created this new project because i had problems of version managment for resolve update project (of the mail received for realize the test) from angular v9 to angular v12, i tried with all alternatives that i know (npm i [--legacy-peer-deps, --force], ng update commands for angular cli and core in project) but i had no solution, after two days trying to relove problems, i've decided create a new one project, i apologize for the problems and i would like to show you the others requirements that i know that are included in the guidelines in the test.

This solution of test can satisfy the evaluation parameters and i wish that this solucion can be taken into account without severity problems in results.
